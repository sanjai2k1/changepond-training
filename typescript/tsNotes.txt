*Typescript : it is superset of javascript
            -it is compile language.
            -it is strict type language.

*software pre-request
1.node js
        node -v //it will show node version
        npm -v // it will display npm version.

2.Typescript
npm i typescript -g //it will install typescript
tsc -v //it wil display typescript version  



*we can create typescript file by writing filename.ts
*how to execute typescript file

step 1: tsc fileNmae.ts // it will compile ts file and generate plain js file
step 2: node filename.js


*how to create variable 
syntax : let variablename:datatype;

*datatype in typescript


*write a function with three parameter fname,lname and display fullname

*oops
1.class : it is collection of data-member and member-function
         -it is template which we can reuse
         -to class we use class keyword
         -class name must start with capital letter
        syntax : class className{
                data-member and member-function
        }
        -this:it represents current or current object
2.object - it is an instance of class
        - by using object we can access class data-member and member-function outside class
        syntax : let objName = new className();

-constructor : it is a special member function of class.
                -constructor execute automatically when class object is created or initialize.
                -constructor name must be only constructor in typescript.

3.Inheritance : accessing parent class property into child class.
                to perform inheritance between two class we use "extends" keyword.
        syntax: class childClassName extends parentClassName.

4.Encapsulation wrapping of data into single unit
5.abstraction
6.polymorphism: ability to take more than one form.
        -method overloading : in this we have multiple methods with same in same class
        -method overiding : in this when we have multiple method with same name in different classes


*module in type : it can be collection of single or multiple typescript file,containing code with specific purpose
                  that data or code we can access in another file by exporting and importing.
                  -we use export keyword to send data
                  -we can importing keyword to access data from file.
