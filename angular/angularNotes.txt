*Angular : it is application designing and development platform for creaing efficient and sophisticated single page application.
            -angular works on component and modules.

*Component : - it is partial part of angular app
-it can be any part of applcation which we can reuse multiple time.

Note: in angular app is rot component

node_module: all libraries or dependency will install in this folder.
package.json : it will keep entry of installed library or packages.
package-lock.json : it will hold detail information of install
readme.md : it will work like guid manual

*how to create component
ng generate component componentName
ng g c foldername/componentName

*how to display individual component view or output
-copy component selector name from its file and wrie selector name as tag where you want.


*Databinding: access data from one file to another in same component
1. interpolation {{}} ts => html
2. property-binding []:ts => html(here we set atrribute value)
3.event-binding (); html => ts (here we call event)
4.two-way data binding[()]: ts <=> html (to perform two-way Databinding) 
-to perform two -way databinding we use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not part of core angular
it is part of forms modules,so first we hav to import formsmodule in our root module(app.module.ts) then and only we can use global directory

Task :create a component with name toggleImg 

*Directives : it is used to perform dom manipulation and change appearance and behaviour of dom elements.

1.structural Directives : it is used to change dom element layout
                        -it is denoted by * symbol

ngStyle: it is use to apply css classes conditionally.
3.custom directive : developer can write logic to create custom directive
-to creae custom directive we have comand
ng generae directive directivename

ng-template - it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.

*pipe : in angular pipe is used to transform property without changing its original value
-to use pipe we use | symbole
1.inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular.
2. custom pipe : pipe developed by developer for use in project
ng generae pipe pipename => custom pipe
3.third party pipe : pipe developed by third party vendor




ng-template : it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.
