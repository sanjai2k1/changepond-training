npm i -g @angular/cli

ng v

step 1: ng new --no-standalone projectname
step 2: cd project name
step 3: code
step 4:npm start --o // this will start angular project in development mode and display output on browser 4200


*Angular : it is application designing and development platform for creaing efficient and sophisticated single page application.
            -angular works on component and modules.

*Component : - it is partial part of angular app
-it can be any part of applcation which we can reuse multiple time.

Note: in angular app is root component

node_module: all libraries or dependency will install in this folder.
package.json : it will keep entry of installed library or packages.
package-lock.json : it will hold detail information of install
readme.md : it will work like guid manual

*how to create component
ng generate component componentName
ng g c foldername/componentName

*how to display individual component view or output
-copy component selector name from its file and wrie selector name as tag where you want.


*Databinding: access data from one file to another in same component
1. interpolation {{}} ts => html
2. property-binding []:ts => html(here we set atrribute value)
3.event-binding (); html => ts (here we call event)
4.two-way data binding[()]: ts <=> html (to perform two-way Databinding) 
-to perform two -way databinding we use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not part of core angular
it is part of forms modules,so first we hav to import formsmodule in our root module(app.module.ts) then and only we can use global directory

Task :create a component with name toggleImg 

*Directives : it is used to perform dom manipulation and change appearance and behaviour of dom elements.

1.structural Directives : it is used to change dom element layout
                        -it is denoted by * symbol
                        -*ngIf: it will display dom element when it get true value otherwise not.
                        -*ngFor: it s use to iterate or repeat dom element
                        -*ngSwitchCase: it is used to diswplay dom element on choice basis
2.attribute directives : it is use to change appearance and behaviour of dom element
ngStyle: it is use to apply css property conditionally.
ngStyle: it is use to apply css classes conditionally.
3.custom directive : developer can write logic to create custom directive
-to creae custom directive we have comand
ng generae directive directivename

ng-template - it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.

*pipe : in angular pipe is used to transform property without changing its original value
-to use pipe we use | symbole
1.inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular.
2. custom pipe : pipe developed by developer for use in project
ng generae pipe pipename => custom pipe
3.third party pipe : pipe developed by third party vendor




ng-template : it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.

*how to use bootstrap in angular
step 1: install bootstrap
npm i bootstrap

step 2: go to angular.json file and import bootstrap file path in Style

step 3 : terminate angular and restart it.


*Routing : navigation of component
          -display component output or view by writing its path in browser url.
          -routing will display component output under <router-outlet> directory.
          -routng is object containing propert wit value.
          -in angular root routing module  name is app-routing -module.ts

*types of routing
1.naming routing: we write component routing path in browser url to display component output.
2.default routing : display component output by default means , keep path value blank in routing
                    - try to keep default routing firt in orderz
3.redirect routing : display component output by writing different path name
4. parameterize routing : passing paramter with path name
5. child roting : define one routing inside another routing
                    -for this in parent parent routing we have to use children property
                    -in parent routing component html file we must write <router-outlet><router-outlet>
6.wildcard routing : display component output ,when user write wrong path in browser url.
                     -in this we write *as value in routing path.
                     -wildcard routing must last routing,router define below to it never work.

*how to navigate one component to another by clicking on button.
*how to create layout.

*Form validation in angular
In angular there are two ways to perform form validation.
1.By using UTDF(User tempalte Driven Form): when we have to perform simple and small form validation 
-in utdf validation in html file.
-in this we use ngModel model directory.

2.By using RTF(Reactive tempalte Form) : 
-when we have write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use rtf.
-in rtf valiaion in ts file
-to Rtf validation firs we have to import ReactiveFormsModule in root module.
-in rtf form validation we use two classes
1.FormGroup: it will hold all form control data in it. as well as it tracks status of form.
2.FormControl: it will track status and validation of individual input control.


states                          class if true          class if  false
the control has been vsited     ng-touched              ng-untouched
the control value ha schanged   ng-dirty             ng-pristine
the control's value is valid    ng-valid                ng-invalid

step 1: import reactiveformsodule in root module(app.module) from formsmodule
step 2: import FormGroup and FormControl class in etf component


*service : in angular service is special class with extra power
-we can share data with multiple component-we can implement bussiness logic in it
-we can perform external communication(fetch data from server)

To create service
ng g service servicename

*how to access service data into any component.
-to access data from service to component for that in component constructor we have to create instance of service  class then we can access service data into component.

- creating service class instance in component constructor is called dependency injection


*How to create REST fake API
dummy server : json-server
npm i -g json-server
database : json database

json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json

*to make request from service to server we have create instance of HyypClient class in service .but HttpClient class is not part of core angular.it is part of httpClientModule.
for this first we have to import HtppClient module in our root module

*to make request from service we have to create instance of HttpClient class in service constructor

*use of concurently library

step 1:npm i -g concurrently
step 2: in json file
"json-server":"cd angular/example/my-app/src/app/shared/database && json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json",
"start-dev":"concurrently \"ng s --o\" \"npm run json-server\"",

*use of font-awesome
npm i font-awesome



*Guard : it prevent to display component view or output.
ng g guard guardName

ng g guard shared/Guards/auth
