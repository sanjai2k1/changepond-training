*Angular : it is application designing and development platform for creaing efficient and sophisticated single page application.
            -angular works on component and modules.

*Component : - it is partial part of angular app
-it can be any part of applcation which we can reuse multiple time.

Note: in angular app is rot component

node_module: all libraries or dependency will install in this folder.
package.json : it will keep entry of installed library or packages.
package-lock.json : it will hold detail information of install
readme.md : it will work like guid manual

*how to create component
ng generate component componentName
ng g c foldername/componentName

*how to display individual component view or output
-copy component selector name from its file and wrie selector name as tag where you want.


*Databinding: access data from one file to another in same component
1. interpolation {{}} ts => html
2. property-binding []:ts => html(here we set atrribute value)
3.event-binding (); html => ts (here we call event)
4.two-way data binding[()]: ts <=> html (to perform two-way Databinding) 
-to perform two -way databinding we use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not part of core angular
it is part of forms modules,so first we hav to import formsmodule in our root module(app.module.ts) then and only we can use global directory
