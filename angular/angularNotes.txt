npm i -g @angular/cli

ng v

step 1: ng new --no-standalone projectname
step 2: cd project name
step 3: code
step 4:npm start --o // this will start angular project in development mode and display output on browser 4200


*Angular : it is application designing and development platform for creaing efficient and sophisticated single page application.
            -angular works on component and modules.

*Component : - it is partial part of angular app
-it can be any part of applcation which we can reuse multiple time.

Note: in angular app is root component

node_module: all libraries or dependency will install in this folder.
package.json : it will keep entry of installed library or packages.
package-lock.json : it will hold detail information of install
readme.md : it will work like guid manual

*how to create component
ng generate component componentName
ng g c foldername/componentName

*how to display individual component view or output
-copy component selector name from its file and wrie selector name as tag where you want.


*Databinding: access data from one file to another in same component
1. interpolation {{}} ts => html
2. property-binding []:ts => html(here we set atrribute value)
3.event-binding (); html => ts (here we call event)
4.two-way data binding[()]: ts <=> html (to perform two-way Databinding) 
-to perform two -way databinding we use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not part of core angular
it is part of forms modules,so first we hav to import formsmodule in our root module(app.module.ts) then and only we can use global directory

Task :create a component with name toggleImg 

*Directives : it is used to perform dom manipulation and change appearance and behaviour of dom elements.

1.structural Directives : it is used to change dom element layout
                        -it is denoted by * symbol
                        -*ngIf: it will display dom element when it get true value otherwise not.
                        -*ngFor: it s use to iterate or repeat dom element
                        -*ngSwitchCase: it is used to diswplay dom element on choice basis
2.attribute directives : it is use to change appearance and behaviour of dom element
ngStyle: it is use to apply css property conditionally.
ngStyle: it is use to apply css classes conditionally.
3.custom directive : developer can write logic to create custom directive
-to creae custom directive we have comand
ng generae directive directivename

ng-template - it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.

*pipe : in angular pipe is used to transform property without changing its original value
-to use pipe we use | symbole
1.inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular.
2. custom pipe : pipe developed by developer for use in project
ng generae pipe pipename => custom pipe
3.third party pipe : pipe developed by third party vendor




ng-template : it is directive which is use to display dom element conditionally.

*how to use bootstrap in angular
step 1: install bootstrap
npm i bootstrap

step 2: go to angular.json file and import bootstrap file path in Style

step 3 : terminate angular and restart it.


*Routing : navigation of component
          -display component output or view by writing its path in browser url.
          -routing will display component output under <router-outlet> directory.
          -routng is object containing propert wit value.
          -in angular root routing module  name is app-routing -module.ts

*types of routing
1.naming routing: we write component routing path in browser url to display component output.
2.default routing : display component output by default means , keep path value blank in routing
                    - try to keep default routing firt in orderz
3.redirect routing : display component output by writing different path name
4. parameterize routing : passing paramter with path name
5. child roting : define one routing inside another routing
                    -for this in parent parent routing we have to use children property
                    -in parent routing component html file we must write <router-outlet><router-outlet>
6.wildcard routing : display component output ,when user write wrong path in browser url.
                     -in this we write *as value in routing path.
                     -wildcard routing must last routing,router define below to it never work.
