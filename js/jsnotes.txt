javascript: - it is used to ad functionality and behaviour into webapp.
            - it is interpreted language.
            - it is loosely typed language.

*there are two ways to use javascript
1.internal js: in html file we use script and in that script we write js code. 
2.external js: first we creae a separae js file and that js file we import in html file by using script tag.

*how to display output in js
1.document.write():it will display output on html webpage. it display output in single line.
2.window.alert(): it will generae one popup and display output in it
3.console.log(): it will gives output in browser console or in terminal.
4.innerHtml(DOM): it allows us to insert data inside an element.

-in Javascript window is global object 
By using DOm to set,get value from element.
-how to apply style rule to an element by using DOM.

*functon :
-it is block of code , which is use to perform specific task.
-it will execute only when we call it.

*There are mainly two types of function.

1.predefine function : available in javascript
2.user-define function : created by user 


*how to get values from input control
*how to use onclick event

 * Data types in javascript
 there are two types data ype
 1.premitive datatype : number,string,boolean,undefined,null
 2.non-premitive datatype : array,object


 *Array :
 -it is use to store multiple values with same datatype in single variable.
 -in array values store on index basis
 -array index always start from zero index.
 -array denoted by [] bracket.
-we can access array data outside array by adding index number


 *length of array : total number of values available in it.
  syntax: arrayName.length
  *array size : total number of index
  syntax: arrayName.size

  *Array method

  *object data type:
  -it is used to store multiple values with different datatype in single variable.
  -in object data store in key and value pair format
  -we can access object data outside for that we write object .keyname.
  -object denoted by {}

  *how to change object data*array of object
  *how to display array of object data


  function:passing one function as an argument inside another function is called callback function.


*settimeOut method: it will call another method only once after particular time interval
     -it takes two parameter 1.callback function,2.time in millisecond

*setInterval method : it will call another method multiple time after particular time interval
    -it takes two parameter 1.callback function,2.time in millisecond


*Date and its method
-if you want to get date and time in web page b using javascript

*exonentiation operator : it will return power of any number
== : it check only value if values are same then it return true result.
=== : it check both value as well as its datatype if both are same hen and only then it return true value.


ex : 5==5 =>true
     '5'==5 =>true
     5===5 =>true
     '5'=== 5 =>false

*Hoisting : it is Javascrit default behavior which moves variable and function declarartion at top of page .means we can use variable declaraion of it.


*difference between var,let,const

var :
-it support hoisting concept
-we can se variable before declaraion of it
-we can redeclare-it

let:
-it do not support hoisting concept.
-we can not use variable before declaraton of it.
-we can not redeclare it.

const :
-it is use to create variable with constant value.
-when we declare constant variable at same time we have to initialize it.
-const variabe value will never change on run time.

*Math method : it is use to perform mathematical operation
Math.ceil(),Math.floor(),Math.round(),Math.random()


String and its method
-it is collection of character.
-in string every letter has index number.
-character index from zero index.
-in string blank space is also consider as string

*how to find index of searching string
1.indexOf("search-String",index?): 
- it will return index of first occurenses of search string.
-it will search string in from left to right direction.
-if searching s not found then it return -1 result.
2.lastIndexOf:
- it will return index of last occurenses of search string.
-it will search string in from  right to left direction.
-if searching s not found then it return -1 result.
3.search:
-fasater than indexof
*how to find part of string from big string
4.slice(start-index,end-index):
-it will return partial part of string from index number.
-slice method will search string from left to right where we pass positive index
-slice method will search string from  right to left where we pass negative index
5.subString:
6.subStr(start-index,total-numberOf-character):
it will return partial part of string from index number.
-slice method will search string from left to right when we pass +ve index

7.split(seperator): it is use to converting string data into array.


8.replace("old text","new text");

9.charAt(index): it return single available on index number


ES5(ECMA script5)2009:
"use strict"
-it executes javascript code in strict mode,in this we can not use variable before declaration of it.
- it always write at starting of js code.

2.trim():
-it is used to remove unwanted white space from both side of string.

-forEach
-map
-filter
-every
-some
-reduce or reduceRight

*prompt : it generate one popup window and allows usr to insert data in it.

*external javascript
-lname,password,mail,contactno,gender
*Form Validation
*perform form validation after submitting form
-for this we use onsubmit event
*perform form validation before submitting form
-for this we use onblur event




// 1.replace task 
// 2. validation task
