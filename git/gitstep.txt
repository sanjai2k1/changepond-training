*exonentiation operator : it will return power of any number
== : it check only value if values are same then it return true result.
=== : it check both value as well as its datatype if both are same hen and only then it return true value.


ex : 5==5 =>true
     '5'==5 =>true
     5===5 =>true
     '5'=== 5 =>false

*Hoisting : it is Javascrit default behavior which moves variable and function declarartion at top of page .means we can use variable declaraion of it.


*difference between var,let,const

var :
-it support hoisting concept
-we can se variable before declaraion of it
-we can redeclare-it

let:
-it do not support hoisting concept.
-we can not use variable before declaraton of it.
-we can not redeclare it.

const :
-it is use to create variable with constant value.
-when we declare constant variable at same time we have to initialize it.
-const variabe value will never change on run time.
