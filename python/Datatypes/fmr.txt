  -> map, filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
    -> map and filter com built-in with python(built in function)
    -> reduce , need to be imported as it resides in the functool module

    -> Syntax
        filter(function,iterable)
        -> function : it tests if each element of a sequence true or not
        -> Sequence : which need to be filtered , it can be list sets, tuples or containinf


 -> Lambda Function(Anonoymous Function) -> function without a name
    -> this function can take any number of arguments but only one expression , which is evaluated and returned             
                                         syntax : lambda arguments : expression 


map() function returns a map object (which is an iterator )of the results 

after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable(list,tuple etc)
or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable 
without using an exlplicit for loop,a technique commonoly known as mapping

syntax:
map(function,iterable ,[iterable1,iterable2....])
