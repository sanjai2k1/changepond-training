      <p>
        The African Grey Parrot is rather plain compared to many of its
        brightly-colored cousins. It is mostly pale gray in color, with slightly
        darker wings. Its neck and chest feathers have white edges, giving them
        a scaly appearance. The bright red tail feathers of the African Grey
        Parrot provide a flash of color. Like all parrots, the African Grey
        Parrot has a strong, curved bill. The upper bill curves over the lower
        bill and ends in a point. The African Grey Parrot has a white face and
        pale yellow eyes. On each foot are four toes, each of which ends with a
        sharp claw. The African Grey Parrot's feet are 'Zygodactyl'. This means
        that inner two toes of each foot face forwards and the outer two face
        backwards. This type of toe arrangement is common among climbing birds,
        and is found in all parrots.

      <p>
        With temperatures in the Arctic tundra averaging -18°F in the winter and
        37°F in the summer, it’s no surprise that the Arctic fox has a number of
        adaptations to enable it to live and function in very cold weather. The
        arctic fox has a thick, multi-layered fur coat that provides excellent
        insulation against the cold. Arctic foxes even have fur on their paws so
        they can walk on snow and ice without getting cold! They use their thick
        tails not only to balance but also as a shelter against the freezing
        wind. The Arctic fox’s fur changes colour with the seasons, providing it
        with year-round camouflage. In the summer its coat is a brown-grey
        colour. This hides the animal against the rocky ground. In the winter
        its coat changes to a white colour for when the ground is covered in
        snow. Under its fur, the arctic fox has a lot of body fat, which helps
        to keep it insulated in the cold. In the autumn, arctic foxes increase
        their fat reserves to provide energy and insulation through the winter.

      <img src="../assets/images/odd-2.jpg" alt="Bald eagles" />
      <p>
        Bald eagles are dark brownish black. Males have a white head, females
        are simply dark all over. Their feet and legs are a bright yellow. Young
        eagles are brown with white spots, and do not get their adult feathers
        until they are between three and five years old. Bald eagles' bodies are
        two to three feet long. Bald eagles weigh six to eight pounds. The
        female is larger than the male, and has a longer wingspan.Eagles love
        fish, and literally snatch them right out of the water. Small animals,
        and waterfowl are also a part of the bald eagle’s diet. They are known
        to steal an osprey’s dinner. The bald eagle swoops down and grabs the
        osprey, forcing it to release it’s prey. This makes an easy dinner for
        the bald eagle. Other “fast food” for these majestic creatures might
        include road kill. In captivity, bald eagles eat rats, or chicks
        sprinkled with vitamin powder. When gliding, bald eagles can reach
        speeds of 40 kilometers an hour, roughly 65 miles an hour. When diving
        after prey, they can reach speeds of up to 160 kilometers an hour, or
        100 miles per hour. Bald eagles use thermal convention currents to soar
        to 3000 feet high, there they glide for hours, using the current to take
        them where they need to go with minimal effort. Bald eagles often use
        these currents to help them migrate.

      <p>
        New-born and young beluga whales are grey or brown in color. The species
        gradually attains its distinctive white color as it reaches adulthood
        (this takes between 7 and 9 years). Some beluga whales are migratory,
        overwintering in deep offshore waters and spending summer in shallow
        coastal waters. Some beluga populations stay in the same place all year
        round. The beluga whale is known to spend time in freshwater habitats,
        and is often seen in estuaries and even in rivers. Beluga whales shed
        the outer layer of their skin once a year by rubbing themselves against
        gravel. The beluga whale lacks a dorsal fin, instead having a dorsal
        ridge (a ridge of hard flesh running along the center of the back).
        Unlike those of other whales, the beluga’s neck vertebrae (the bones of
        its neck) aren’t fused. This allows the beluga to look around without
        moving its whole body. The beluga travels in pods ranging in size from a
        few individuals to several thousand. The average group consists of 10
        individuals. The beluga whale is nicknamed the ‘canary of the sea’ due
        to its numerous high-pitched vocalizations.

      <img src="../assets/images/odd-3.jpg" alt="capybaras" />
      <p>
        Capybaras look a little like overgrown guinea pigs, which is no
        surprise: the animals are closely related. Capybaras have big,
        barrel-shaped bodies with rather square heads. Their long, thick hair is
        varying shades of golden or reddish-brown. The capybara’s eyes, nose and
        mouth are located near the top of its head. This allows it to see and
        breathe while the rest of its body is under water. Capybaras have other
        adaptations for a semi-aquatic life. While diving, capybaras can press
        their ears flat against their heads to prevent water getting in. They
        can stay underwater for up to five minutes. Capybaras also have slightly
        webbed feet with big claws. This helps them not only to swim but also to
        walk on the slippery rainforest floor. The capybara’s fur helps to
        retain heat and dries quickly after it leaves the water.

    <div class="even">
      <img src="../assets/images/even-3.jpg" alt="Ostrich" />
      <p>
        Ostrich feathers lack the tiny hooks that hold the feathers of other
        birds together. Because of this an ostrich’s feathers are fluffy and
        loose. The ostrich's neck is covered in small, downy feathers, and its
        legs are largely bare. The skin varies in color from pale grey to
        reddish-pink. The lower leg is covered in scales – a reminder of the
        bird’s dinosaur ancestry. An ostrich’s legs are extremely strong,
        enabling the animal to run at high speeds (we’ll find out just how fast
        further down the page) and also to deliver a powerful defensive kick.
        Ostriches have two toes, unlike most other birds, which have four. This
        may be an adaptation to allow it to run faster. The inner toe has a
        large, hoof-like claw. The ostrich has long eyelashes to protect its
        huge eyes, which are larger than those of any other bird. In fact each
        of the ostrich's eyeballs is bigger than its brain!

      <img src="../assets/images/odd-4.jpg" alt="Elephants" />
      <p>
        Elephants are so big and heavy that they can’t jump. The skin of an
        elephant is an inch thick. Elephants can’t see very well, but they do
        have a very good sense of smell (well, they would do with those noses!)
        It takes 22 months for a baby elephant to be ready to be born (it only
        takes 9 months for a human baby). Elephants use their tusks for lifting
        things and digging for water. Elephants are very playful and like
        swimming. Elephants live in family groups called herds, and there are
        about 12-15 elephants in a herd. Male elephants are called bulls, female
        elephants are called cows and young elephants are called calves – just
        like cows! The ears of elephants are large and thin and they can hear
        even the quietest sound. Elephants have feelings and emotions like
        humans – they hug each other, play, and feel sad when another elephant
        dies.

    <div class="even">
      <img src="../assets/images/even-4.jpg" alt="Giraffee" />
      <p>
        There are nine subspecies of giraffes. The giraffe and okapi are the
        only two members of the Giraffidae family. The giraffe is a ruminant
        animal. This means they regurgitate their food, chewing it over and over
        again, like a cow. They also have four chambers in their stomach, like
        the cow. Giraffes can drink 10 gallons of water at a time. In order to
        pump blood through their long, large bodies, giraffes have an equally
        large heart. It weighs 22-24lbs and beats 170 times per minute. The
        giraffe moves at two rates: an amble (about 10 mph) and the gallop (up
        to 35mph). Their front and back legs on one side move together, followed
        by the front and back legs on the other side. When they gallop, their
        back legs will pass in front of the front legs. The giraffe’s tongue is
        a blue-black color. A giraffe’s lungs can hold 12 gallons of air.
        Giraffes only sleep for 20 minutes to 2 hours every day. Giraffes can’t
        swim.

      <p>
        Jaguars are solitary creatures, and adults spend most of their time
        alone. Unlike most cats, jaguars are excellent swimmers and can swim
        across rivers. The word ‘jaguar’ comes from the Native American word
        ‘yajuar’, which means 'he who kills with one leap'. Jaguars have the
        third most powerful bites of all cats. Jaguars can see six times better
        than humans. The jaguar's scientific name is Panthera onca. Jaguars are
        masters at ambush hunting and stalking. In the wild, jaguars live for
        12-15 years. Jaguars are carnivores, with varied diets that includes
        fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. Jaguars' rosettes are bigger than
        thos of leopards, and have a spot in the centre

      <p>
        When kangaroos hop, they use both legs at once but kangaroos are also
        able to walk around on all four legs. Kangaroos can't walk backwards. A
        kangaroo’s lifespan is about six years Kangaroos can swim! The largest
        kangaroo is the red kangaroo and the smallest kangaroo is the musky
        rat-kangaroo. A new-born kangaroo is less than an inch long. A male
        kangaroo is called a buck, boomer or jack and a female kangaroo is
        called a doe, flyer or jill. A female kangaroo’s pouch may contain two
        babies if they are born a year apart. The mother kangaroo makes two
        different kinds of milk for the two joeys Kangaroos can move their legs
        independently only in water, not on land The four most common types of
        kangaroos are the red kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo, the western
        grey kangaroo and the antilopine kangaroo. Red kangaroos are the largest
        marsupials (animals with a pouch). Kangaroos communicate through noises
        like grunting, coughing, hissing, clicking or clucking The kangaroo is
        the unofficial symbol of Australia and they have been featured on some
        of Australia’s form of currency (money)
